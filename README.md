# COSIFE-Electrochemical-Oxygen-Sensor-Project
This is a porject based on DFRobot Gravity I2C Oxygen Sensor and DHT22 Humidity Sensor. With the control of Elegoo uno R3 microcontroller, it could detect the real- time oxygen concentration, related humidity, and temperature. Since this system is expected to be applied in the laboratary portable glovebox, a passive buzzer, a LCD Display and a green LED are used as additional functions. During the operation, when the oxygen level decreases below a specific threshold, the alarm system will be initialized. Then once the threshold is passed, the passive buzzer will start alarming with the led begin fleshed. All the data will be displayed both on the serial monitor and the LCD screen. A 16GB micro SD card including all the user instructions is used to store the data in a spread csv. file.
